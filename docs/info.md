## How it works
This program uses logic gates to convert a user input
of a binary number into its base-10 form.

## How to test
Input:
To use the converter, enter a binary combination with the
last three switches on the red set of switches.

Output:
If the output is not 0, the converter will light up one bar on the 
bar graph based on the input. Each box correlates to one base-10 
number from 1 to 7, and they are counted from the bottom up, i.e. the first 
box from the bottom represents the number 1 and the seventh box from the bottom 
represents the number 7.
If the binary input is 0, the red LED below the bar graph wll light up.

## External hardware
A bar graph light, a single LED, and an eight-count switch
